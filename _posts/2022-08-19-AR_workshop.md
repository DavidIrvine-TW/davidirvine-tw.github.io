# Why technical writers should use GitHub to host their portfolios?
---

## You need a portfolio

A portfolio is a requirement for all technical writers. It doesn’t matter if you’re new to technical writing or a grizzled Rambo with experience dating back to dial-up. You need a portfolio to showcase your work and land that job!

The internet offers a number of reliable solutions, from simple Dropbox or Google Drive links to elaborate personal websites and blogs. Whatever solution you choose, it’s important to understand that a portfolio platform can be much more than just a space to showcase your collection of static work samples.

## GitHub

GitHub’s association with software development doesn’t mean it’s a tool exclusive only to developers and code writers. A GitHub repository can be used to store virtually any kind of data, and this includes your writing, which isn’t too dissimilar from code – think lines of text. Testament to GitHub’s flexibility, someone used it to write a [novel](https://joebuhlig.com/writing-a-book-with-github/), and another used it to write an [instruction manual](https://qz.com/335942/an-author-used-a-tool-for-programmers-to-write-a-book/). GitHub goes far beyond *just* the provision of space to display your portfolio!

Here are five intangible benefits on offer at GitHub not easily found elsewhere:

- ### It shows you’re tech-savvy

As a technical writer, it makes not only good sense to choose a technical platform such as GitHub, but also a savvy one too. Now having a GitHub account doesn’t make you Steve Wozniack, but it does infer that you associate yourself with that niche of professional and that you’re also comfortable with tech.

- ### Your toolbox

Given the requirements of different projects you work on, you’ll have the opportunity to display proficiency across a range of document types and technical writing tools. This is a great way to show recruiters and hiring managers how flexible and adaptable you are. You can be the proverbial “Swiss-Army knife” of technical writing - multifaceted.

- ### Open-source access

GitHub is a door to the world of open source. If you’re new to technical writing then your first challenge is to figure out how to fill an empty portfolio with content you have confidence in. One way to overcome this obstacle is to contribute to open-source projects.  GitHub gives you the access and opportunity to gain that much-needed experience. Or, if you’re an experienced technical writer it’s a great way to develop your network and actively participate in the community.

- ### GitHub’s network

A GitHub profile provides access to the work processes of each of its members. As GitHub’s membership base is vast, this feature provides unprecedented access to developments all across the spectrum of software innovation and design.

- ### Communication skills

You can demonstrate your communication and collaboration skills. Visitors to your profile can gain insight into your thought processes by reviewing a project’s comment narrative. This is a great way to demonstrate professionalism and show that you’re an effective team player.  

Choosing GitHub as the home for your technical writing portfolio is a great option and a lot more than just a place to display your writing samples.
