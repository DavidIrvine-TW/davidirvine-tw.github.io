# Create your GitHub profile README 
---
Your public profile README is the place to share relevant personal information with the GitHub community. You can use it to express things of general interest and fun, or you can use it to introduce yourself, it’s entirely up to you, it’s your profile.

The following tutorial will take you through the steps to create a README for your GitHub public profile. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, use this [link](https://www.github.com) to create one.

1. Go to your GitHub profile.

2. Click on the upper-right “+” drop-down menu, and select “New repository.” See Fig 01.
