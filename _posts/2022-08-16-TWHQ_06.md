## I forgot my password 

Sorry, but there is nothing we can do to recover your password. Bitwarden uses zero-knowledge encryption to conceal your password. This method of encryption is a one-way process. Bitwarden cannot reverse it.

## Can I backup my vault?

Yes, you can back up your vault. Your vault data can be exported in an encrypted JSON file. Exports are encrypted using your account’s encryption key and are unique to each Bitwarden user.

## Can I view my password history?

Yes, you can view your password history. The last five passwords for any login item can be viewed. To do so, first, select an item and click “1,” next to password history at the bottom of your vault window.

> **Warning!** - clicking on password history will display your historical passwords in plaintext.

## Can I print my vault data?

No, you can’t print vault data directly from Bitwarden. You can however, export vault data as a JSON or .CSV file and print it from a text editor.
Does Bitwarden only store passwords?
No, Bitwarden doesn’t only store passwords. Bitwarden can secure any data that can be stored in plaintext formats.

## Why should I trust Bitwarden?
There are several reasons to trust Bitwarden:
- Bitwarden’s source code is available online and has been reviewed by hundreds of developers. Bitwarden only does what it claims to do, nothing else. 

- Bitwarden routinely undergoes security audits from 3rd party security firms and individual researchers.

- Bitwarden does not store your passwords. Bitwarden stores encrypted versions of passwords that only you can unlock.

- Bitwarden uses AES-CBC 256-bit encryption for your vault data and PBKDF2 SHA-256 to derive your encryption key.

## What if Bitwarden gets hacked?

Your vault and password information are still protected – they’re encrypted by one-way salt-hashing.
