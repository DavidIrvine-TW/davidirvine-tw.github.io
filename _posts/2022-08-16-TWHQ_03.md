## The need for password managers

Each year more people move more of their real-world lives onto the internet. Inevitably, the more online your life becomes, the more passwords you can expect to manage.

Security experts recommend using randomly generated passwords for each account you create. The problem then is how best to manage a growing number of random passwords in a way that maintains good password hygiene - not recording and storing them somewhere in plaintext format.

If you’re tired of clicking on “forgot password” or are guilty of using the same password across multiple accounts, then it’s time to start thinking about getting yourself a reliable password manager.

## What is Bitwarden?

Bitwarden is an open-source password management service that’s user-friendly, highly secure, and includes everything individuals, teams, and businesses require in a password manager.  

Bitwarden offers a free plan which includes multi-device sync, two-factor authentication (2FA), and the ability to import from other password managers, which makes it easy to try out Bitwarden at no upfront cost.
Available as a browser extension, desktop client, and mobile application, Bitwarden is a reliable and secure password manager with extensive user features.

Bitwarden highlights include:
- AES-256 encryption
- Zero-knowledge cryptography
- Auto-fill
- Password generator

## Master password security – browser extension

A Bitwarden vault is protected by a single long “master” password, encrypted using PBKDF2 zero-knowledge cryptography. As a Bitwarden cloud client, your master password and email are salt-hashed twice before storage – first, on your device and again by Bitwarden before storage in our database.

Bitwarden only ever receives hashed versions of your password information.

## Master password security – desktop client

Your master password will never be transmitted to Bitwarden servers, as all encryption is performed locally. Your master password is only temporarily stored in local RAM while it’s in use. It’s then purged from your system’s memory when the decryption of your vault has been completed.

Bitwarden will never store any plain text data on its servers or on your local devices.

## Only you know what’s in the vault

Zero-knowledge hash functions are a “one way” only process. This ensures no one at Bitwarden can ever reverse engineer hashes to obtain “actual” passwords. Bitwarden will never know anything about the contents of your vault. All Bitwarden keeps is proof that you have the key – the master password. The only person who knows what’s inside your vault is you!

Bitwarden doesn’t offer a master password recovery option. If you lose your password, your vault is lost. Not even Bitwarden can ever gain access to it.

## Vault security

Each piece of information stored in a Bitwarden vault is encrypted using the AES-256 cipher – the same end-to-end encryption process used by the world’s national security agencies to protect the highest levels of top-secret information.

## Compliance
Bitwarden security and compliance policies are based on the ISO27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS). Bitwarden also meets the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) standards.

In November 2018, Bitwarden passed a third-party security and cryptographic analysis assessment performed by [Cure 53](https://cure53.de/). The assessment covered the Bitwarden application and back-end server systems. Bitwarden also passed a security assessment and penetration test performed by [Insight Risk Consulting](http://insightriskconsulting.co.uk/).
As Bitwarden is an open-source product, its source code is available online, which means it’s open for scrutiny by cyber-security professionals. This ensures that Bitwarden does only what it says it does and nothing else.

## Is Bitwarden safe?

Yes, by using the AES-256 cipher, hacking into a Bitwarden vault is virtually impossible. And due to Bitwarden’s zero-knowledge encryption policy, not even Bitwarden has access to the data stored in its vaults.
