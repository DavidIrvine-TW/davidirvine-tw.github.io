# [R/D] Q3 - Exploring free password management solutions
---
## The problem

The National Cyber-Security Agency recently published the findings of its 2021 password security survey – we are concerned.

It found that 85% of people use variants of the same passwords. The survey also reports that people are still using pen and paper.  A large number are also unconvinced their data is any safer with password managers than it is with them – they don’t trust us.  

People realize the risks involved with poor password hygiene, but continue to do it anyway.

The purpose of this report is:

- To increase public awareness of Bitwarden password manager.
- To align with our [values](https://opensource.com/open-source-way).

## Proposed solution

Bitwarden must aim to provide the most comprehensive, free password management solution available.

Each personal account will include:

- Unlimited passwords  
- Unlimited devices
- All core functions (see feature specifications for full list)
- Vault sharing (one other user)
- Always free

Business and family account feature sets will remain under premium subscription but at a reduced rate of $10 for the first year.

We project that this strategy will increase our share of the password management market by up to four percent annually.

## Our values

Alone, a free Bitwarden vault does not guarantee our success in the password management industry. Nor will it alone increase public trust in password management solutions. It does however align with our open-source values! A free Bitwarden vault with such an extensive feature set can positively impact public perception of the Bitwarden brand and its modern internet security policies.

Bitwarden’s mission is to create a world where no one can be hacked. Making a Bitwarden vault available to all users echoes our values, promotes our personal responsibility to the community, and helps raise public awareness of Bitwarden’s open-source approach to password management.

## Final thoughts and next steps

Public trust can be more easily attained when the public realizes the extent to which their data is encrypted. The truth is user data is incomprehensible, even to Bitwarden. This “truth” has market value, and can be leveraged to increase public confidence in our privacy policies and our serious approach to data security.

We recommend that campaigns begin to promote Bitwarden’s mission statement. Social media platforms and blogs are to be targeted as grounds to promote use cases and user journeys. Bitwarden’s security infrastructure is to be demonstrated and explained to enhance user awareness of the cryptographic processes deployed by Bitwarden in protecting their data.
