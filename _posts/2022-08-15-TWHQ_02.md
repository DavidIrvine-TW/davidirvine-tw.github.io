# [COO] Q1 - What we learned from the National Cyber-Security Agency’s (NCSA) 2021 annual report
---
## Used but underutilized
People are moving more of their lives onto cloud-based services, creating an exponential challenge of increasing importance for security firms. Malware, phishing scams, hackers, and data breaches all represent a continuous threat to secured and unsecured data.

Password managers coordinate login credentials and secure user data – they’re the most practical and effective defense from attack. Unfortunately, they are severely underutilized, as highlighted by the National Cyber-Security Agency’s 2021 [password research survey](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/most-hacked-passwords-revealed-as-uk-cyber-survey-exposes-gaps-in-online-security).

Key findings:

## Popular password management methods

Standard memorization remains the most popular way of keeping track of online passwords, followed by an assortment of low-tech alternatives. See Figure 01 for details.

| Fig 01: NCSA 2021 | *multiple responses permitted|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Memorization | 41% |
| Pen and paper | 30% |
| Save in a browser | 24% |
| Save in a digital note (plaintext) | 23% |
| Reuse old passwords | 20% |
| Use a password manager | 8% |

## Reasons for using a password manager

The most-cited reasons for using a password manager emphasized their notable strengths – generating, storing, and encrypting complex codes across multiple platforms. See Figure 02 for details.

| Fig 02: NCSA 2021| *multiple responses permitted|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Can’t remember all my passwords | 71% |
| Apply login across multiple devices | 51% |
| Generate/save complex passwords | 45% |
| Manage apps with multiple logins | 38% |
| Password encryption| 34% |
| Ease of a single master password | 24% |

## Reasons against a password manager

The primary reasons cited against the adoption of password management services are rooted more in unfamiliarity than in fact. Clients embrace the convenience, while skeptics question security. See Figure 03 for details.

| Fig 03: NCSA 2021 | *multiple responses permitted|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Don’t believe they’re secure | 63% |
| Not sure I need one | 49% |
| Don’t know how they work | 51% |
| Cost too much | 36% |
| Difficult to set up | 34% |
| Time-consuming | 24% |

## Will you consider using a password manager?

Respondents without a password manager were most worried about security. Presumably they’re unaware of the extent to which encryption keeps their data protected in the rare case of breach. See Figure 04 for details.

Most of those who currently don’t use a password manager are willing to try one.

| Fig 04: NCSA 2021 | |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Yes | 69% |
| No | 31% |
