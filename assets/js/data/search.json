It doesn’t matter if you’re new to technical writing or a grizzled Rambo with experience dating back to dial-up. You need a portfolio to showcase your work and land that job!The internet offers a number of reliable solutions, from simple Dropbox or Google Drive links to elaborate personal websites and blogs. Whatever solution you choose, it’s important to understand that a portfolio platform can be much more than just a space to showcase your collection of static work samples.GitHubGitHub’s association with software development doesn’t mean it’s a tool exclusive only to developers and code writers. A GitHub repository can be used to store virtually any kind of data, and this includes your writing, which isn’t too dissimilar from code – think lines of text. Testament to GitHub’s flexibility, someone used it to write a novel, and another used it to write an instruction manual. GitHub goes far beyond just the provision of space to display your portfolio!Here are five intangible benefits on offer at GitHub not easily found elsewhere: It shows you’re tech-savvy As a technical writer, it makes not only good sense to choose a technical platform such as GitHub, but also a savvy one too. Now having a GitHub account doesn’t make you Steve Wozniack, but it does infer that you associate yourself with that niche of professional and that you’re also comfortable with tech. Your toolbox Given the requirements of different projects you work on, you’ll have the opportunity to display proficiency across a range of document types and technical writing tools. This is a great way to show recruiters and hiring managers how flexible and adaptable you are. You can be the proverbial “Swiss-Army knife” of technical writing - multifaceted. Open-source access GitHub is a door to the world of open source. If you’re new to technical writing then your first challenge is to figure out how to fill an empty portfolio with content you have confidence in. One way to overcome this obstacle is to contribute to open-source projects. GitHub gives you the access and opportunity to gain that much-needed experience. Or, if you’re an experienced technical writer it’s a great way to develop your network and actively participate in the community. GitHub’s network A GitHub profile provides access to the work processes of each of its members. As GitHub’s membership base is vast, this feature provides unprecedented access to developments all across the spectrum of software innovation and design. Communication skills You can demonstrate your communication and collaboration skills. Visitors to your profile can gain insight into your thought processes by reviewing a project’s comment narrative. This is a great way to demonstrate professionalism and show that you’re an effective team player.Choosing GitHub as the home for your technical writing portfolio is a great option and a lot more than just a place to display your writing samples.Get a free GitHub account here." }, { "title": "PDF view|download", "url": "/posts/TWHQ_full/", "categories": "Technical Writer HQ", "tags": "PDF, downloads", "date": "2022-08-17 19:40:00 +0700", "snippet": "Standalone Doc setsTechnical Writer HQ Amruta Ranade: technical writing workshop" }, { "title": "Bitwarden user persona", "url": "/posts/TWHQ_08/", "categories": "Technical Writer HQ", "tags": "bitwarden, user persona", "date": "2022-08-16 20:42:00 +0700", "snippet": "Bitwarden" }, { "title": "Release notes", "url": "/posts/TWHQ_07/", "categories": "Technical Writer HQ", "tags": "bitwarden, release notes", "date": "2022-08-16 20:23:00 +0700", "snippet": "Update: 2022.6.0:exclamation: NOTE: We have adopted a new numbering systemAs Bitwarden moves towards a near-monthly release cycle, we’ve decided to adopt a new release numbering system to share across all clients.This release is 2022.6.0 because it’s the base release (.0) of June (.6) 2022 (2022).The Bitwarden 2022.6.0 update includes key features and usability improvements to make life easier on-the-go: Auto-fill account switching (IOS): You can now switch between accounts during auto-fill – just tap the avatar button.

Inevitably, the more online your life becomes, the more passwords you can expect to manage.Security experts recommend using randomly generated passwords for each account you create. The problem then is how best to manage a growing number of random passwords in a way that maintains good password hygiene - not recording and storing them somewhere in plaintext format.If you’re tired of clicking on “forgot password” or are guilty of using the same password across multiple accounts, then it’s time to start thinking about getting yourself a reliable password manager.What is Bitwarden?Bitwarden is an open-source password management service that’s user-friendly, highly secure, and includes everything individuals, teams, and businesses require in a password manager.Bitwarden offers a free plan which includes multi-device sync, two-factor authentication (2FA), and the ability to import from other password managers, which makes it easy to try out Bitwarden at no upfront cost.Available as a browser extension, desktop client, and mobile application, Bitwarden is a reliable and secure password manager with extensive user features.Bitwarden highlights include: AES-256 encryption Zero-knowledge cryptography Auto-fill Password generatorMaster password security – browser extensionA Bitwarden vault is protected by a single long “master” password, encrypted using PBKDF2 zero-knowledge cryptography. As a Bitwarden cloud client, your master password and email are salt-hashed twice before storage – first, on your device and again by Bitwarden before storage in our database.Bitwarden only ever receives hashed versions of your password information.Master password security – desktop clientYour master password will never be transmitted to Bitwarden servers, as all encryption is performed locally. Your master password is only temporarily stored in local RAM while it’s in use. It’s then purged from your system’s memory when the decryption of your vault has been completed.Bitwarden will never store any plain text data on its servers or on your local devices.Only you know what’s in the vaultZero-knowledge hash functions are a “one way” only process. This ensures no one at Bitwarden can ever reverse engineer hashes to obtain “actual” passwords. Bitwarden will never know anything about the contents of your vault. All Bitwarden keeps is proof that you have the key – the master password. The only person who knows what’s inside your vault is you!Bitwarden doesn’t offer a master password recovery option. If you lose your password, your vault is lost. Not even Bitwarden can ever gain access to it.Vault securityEach piece of information stored in a Bitwarden vault is encrypted using the AES-256 cipher – the same end-to-end encryption process used by the world’s national security agencies to protect the highest levels of top-secret information.ComplianceBitwarden security and compliance policies are based on the ISO27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS). Bitwarden also meets the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) standards.In November 2018, Bitwarden passed a third-party security and cryptographic analysis assessment performed by Cure 53. The assessment covered the Bitwarden application and back-end server systems. Bitwarden also passed a security assessment and penetration test performed by Insight Risk Consulting.As Bitwarden is an open-source product, its source code is available online, which means it’s open for scrutiny by cyber-security professionals. This ensures that Bitwarden does only what it says it does and nothing else.Is Bitwarden safe?Yes, by using the AES-256 cipher, hacking into a Bitwarden vault is virtually impossible. And due to Bitwarden’s zero-knowledge encryption policy, not even Bitwarden has access to the data stored in its vaults.To learn more, visit Bitwarden here." }, { "title": "Knowledge base", "url": "/posts/TWHQ_02/", "categories": "Technical Writer HQ", "tags": "bitwarden, knowledge base", "date": "2022-08-15 14:13:00 +0700", "snippet": "[COO] Q1 - What we learned from the National Cyber-Security Agency’s (NCSA) 2021 annual reportUsed but underutilizedPeople are moving more of their lives onto cloud-based services, creating an exponential challenge of increasing importance for security firms. Malware, phishing scams, hackers, and data breaches all represent a continuous threat to secured and unsecured data.Password managers coordinate login credentials and secure user data – they’re the most practical and effective defense from attack. Unfortunately, they are severely underutilized, as highlighted by the National Cyber-Security Agency’s 2021 password research survey.Key findings:Popular password management methodsStandard memorization remains the most popular way of keeping track of online passwords, followed by an assortment of low-tech alternatives. See Figure 01 for details. Fig 01: NCSA 2021 *multiple responses permitted Memorization 41% Pen and paper 30% Save in a browser 24% Save in a digital note (plaintext) 23% Reuse old passwords 20% Use a password manager 8% Reasons for using a password managerThe most-cited reasons for using a password manager emphasized their notable strengths – generating, storing, and encrypting complex codes across multiple platforms. See Figure 02 for details. Fig 02: NCSA 2021 *multiple responses permitted Can’t remember all my passwords 71% Apply login across multiple devices 51% Generate/save complex passwords 45% Manage apps with multiple logins 38% Password encryption 34% Ease of a single master password 24% Reasons against a password managerThe primary reasons cited against the adoption of password management services are rooted more in unfamiliarity than in fact. Clients embrace the convenience, while skeptics question security. See Figure 03 for details. Fig 03: NCSA 2021 *multiple responses permitted Don’t believe they’re secure 63% Not sure I need one 49% Don’t know how they work 51% Cost too much 36% Difficult to set up 34% Time-consuming 24% Will you consider using a password manager?Respondents without a password manager were most worried about security. Presumably they’re unaware of the extent to which encryption keeps their data protected in the rare case of breach. See Figure 04 for details.Most of those who currently don’t use a password manager are willing to try one. Fig 04: NCSA 2021   Yes 69% No 31% Market evaluationBitwarden’s estimated 2021 market share (Q4) is up three percent on NCSA 2020.

The survey also reports that people are still using pen and paper. A large number are also unconvinced their data is any safer with password managers than it is with them – they don’t trust us.People realize the risks involved with poor password hygiene, but continue to do it anyway.The purpose of this report is: To increase public awareness of Bitwarden password manager. To align with our values.Proposed solutionBitwarden must aim to provide the most comprehensive, free password management solution available.Each personal account will include: Unlimited passwords Unlimited devices All core functions (see feature specifications for full list) Vault sharing (one other user) Always freeBusiness and family account feature sets will remain under premium subscription but at a reduced rate of $10 for the first year.We project that this strategy will increase our share of the password management market by up to four percent annually.Our valuesAlone, a free Bitwarden vault does not guarantee our success in the password management industry. Nor will it alone increase public trust in password management solutions. It does however align with our open-source values! A free Bitwarden vault with such an extensive feature set can positively impact public perception of the Bitwarden brand and its modern internet security policies.Bitwarden’s mission is to create a world where no one can be hacked. Making a Bitwarden vault available to all users echoes our values, promotes our personal responsibility to the community, and helps raise public awareness of Bitwarden’s open-source approach to password management.Final thoughts and next stepsPublic trust can be more easily attained when the public realizes the extent to which their data is encrypted. The truth is user data is incomprehensible, even to Bitwarden. This “truth” has market value, and can be leveraged to increase public confidence in our privacy policies and our serious approach to data security.We recommend that campaigns begin to promote Bitwarden’s mission statement. Social media platforms and blogs are to be targeted as grounds to promote use cases and user journeys. Bitwarden’s security infrastructure is to be demonstrated and explained to enhance user awareness of the cryptographic processes deployed by Bitwarden in protecting their data." } ]
